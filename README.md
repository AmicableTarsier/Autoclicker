# Autoclicker

This is an Autoclicker written in Python designed to supplement Minecraft.
To be used for AFK XP farms

To run: open the GUI window and click the "Start" button

The autoclicker waits 10 seconds so you can navigate back to Minecraft, then begins clicking.

Every 10 minutes, the Autoclicker will scroll up then right click to ensure you do not run out of hunger
It then scrolls back down and resumes clicking.

Enjoy!
